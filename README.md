#### Professor,
##### To run this program only make sure of having:
1. A terminal capable of executing shell scripts (preferencially **bash**).
2. Python version 3.5 or superior installed and being called by ```python3``` command.
3. The virtualenv installed and capable of creating environment for ```python3```.

##### To set the environment
1. Navigate through the terminal to the directory where the project is.
2. execute the script "RUNME" with the command
```bash
source RUNME
```

**NOTE**: if everything runs just nicely, in front of you line in the command line will be the string "(virEnv)", indicating that you have the virtualenv environment activated.

##### To run the project:
1. execute the main with the command
```bash
python main.py
```

PS.: the RUNME script was tested only in **bash**, so if you willing to try it in another shell, you're on your own.

PPS.: Changes are that the  **ksh** shell would work just fine too.
